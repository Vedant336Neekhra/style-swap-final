Used this - https://github.com/lucidrains/stylegan2-pytorch
stylgan2 for training.

The official NV labs one - https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch?tab=readme-ov-file require python 3.7, torch 1.8 to which we have to create a env or change python versions in colab(can do on local, but we have compute on colab so :) ) usr/bin which was a total nightmare(3 hrs wasted successfully)
